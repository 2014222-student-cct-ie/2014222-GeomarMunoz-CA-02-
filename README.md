Scenario

“Like it or not, every construction company—and solutions provider—is now also in the data business. How
well we help our customers transform that data into intelligence that drives better decisions to deliver
projects more efficiently and more sustainably, with higher quality, lower costs and fewer risks is what
defines the next frontier of construction management. Data is the key to improving the bottom line as well
as protecting it. Our ability to break down data silos and transform raw data into action and intelligence is
the crux to solving most challenges that rear their head in our industry. Solve the data problem and
everything else falls into place.”—Jon Fingland, General Manager, Collaboration Solutions, Trimble

sector with other countries worldwide. This analysis should also include forecasting, sentiment analysis and
evidence-based recommendations for the sector as well as a complete rationale of the entire process used
to discover your findings. Your Research could include export, import, trade imbalance, house production,
material stock, labour/skill pool, etc. (or any other relevant topic EXCEPT Climate change) with Ireland as
your base line.
